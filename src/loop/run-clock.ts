// THE CLOCK AN APP STEPS ITS ENGINE ON. The display hands the app frames at
// whatever rate it likes; a deterministic engine takes steps of exactly
// `1 / hz`. This is the accumulator between the two, DOM-free so a suite can
// hold it to the three decisions below without a browser. The app feeds it
// `requestAnimationFrame`'s clock and the page's visibility; it hands back
// how many steps to take.
//
// THE THREE DECISIONS, each stated once:
//
// - THE FRAME DELTA IS CLAMPED to `MAX_FRAME_SECONDS` and THE TIME BEYOND IT
//   IS DROPPED, never paid down later. A hitch, a garbage
//   collection, a laptop lid: the run resumes where it was, a tenth of a
//   second at most behind, rather than simulating the stall at a hundred
//   steps a frame until the debt spirals. A run is not a clock nobody may
//   stop; it is the player's, and they were not riding it while the machine
//   was away.
// - LOSING FOCUS PAUSES THE RUN. This is a single-player game: a
//   hidden tab, a minimised window or a phone call stops the world, the
//   run clock included, and coming back lands on the very frame it left.
//   The accumulator is emptied on resume so the first frame back is one
//   frame long and not the whole absence — returning is never a stall.
// - THE SIMULATION NEVER LEARNS THE FRAME RATE. Steps are whole; the
//   fraction of a step left in the accumulator carries to the next frame,
//   and `alpha` is offered to the renderer for interpolation only — nothing
//   in the engine ever reads it.

/** The most frame time one frame may hand the accumulator, s — the default
 * clamp; `createRunClock` takes another. Twelve steps at 120 Hz — a frame a good deal longer than that is a stall, not a slow
 * frame, and its time is dropped. */
