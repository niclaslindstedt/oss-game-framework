// THE CLOCK — the one place a deterministic engine reads the wall clock.
//
// The simulation never reads it: a run is its seed and its inputs, and a
// clock's value reaching the state or a draw would make two runs of the same
// seed disagree. What does read it is the code that REPORTS on itself — an
// analysis or rating pass saying how many milliseconds it took, a recorded
// tape saying when it was recorded. Those take a `Clock` as a parameter,
// defaulting to `wallClock`, and call `now()` on it; none of them calls
// `Date.now` itself. A test hands in `fixedClock(…)` and gets byte-identical
// reports back, which is what "deterministic" has to mean for a report that
// carries a timing.
