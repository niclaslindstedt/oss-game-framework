// THE SHELL HELD OVER THE PART OF THE SCREEN THE BROWSER IS SHOWING.
//
// The game is one fixed, non-scrolling shell the size of the viewport, and
// that is a bet: that the viewport the page is laid out in is the screen the
// player is looking at. A software keyboard is where the bet comes off. iOS
// does not re-lay the page for one — it keeps the layout viewport at its full
// height, makes the VISIBLE window short, and slides that window down the
// layout viewport so the field being typed into stays above the keys. Every
// `position: fixed` surface stays behind with the layout viewport, so the
// game ends up somewhere off the bottom of the screen with the app's own
// background colour (`BRAND_COLOR`, the manifest's `background_color`) where
// it used to be. On an iPhone held on its side that is about 245 of 393 px —
// nearly two thirds of the picture — and the keyboard does not have to still
// be up for it to be on screen: a field unmounted while it still had focus
// takes the keyboard away and leaves the offset behind.
//
// So how far that window has been pushed off each edge is measured and
// published as two lengths, and the stylesheet lays the shell out inside what
// is left rather than against the viewport's own edges. The arithmetic is
// `viewport.ts`'s `visibleBox` (DOM-free, and tested); what is here is the
// listening, the writing, and the one repair.
//
// THE REPAIR: an offset window with nothing focused is a window the browser
// forgot to put back, and scrolling to the origin is what puts it back.
// Guarded by the focus, because while a field really is being typed into the
// offset is the browser doing its job and fighting it would scroll the keys
// back over the field on every keystroke.

 * ONLY THE DISPLACEMENT IS WRITTEN, never a height. How tall the viewport is

 * `100vh` reaches the physical bottom of the screen where the layout viewport
