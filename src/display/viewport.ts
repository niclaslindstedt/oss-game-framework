// THE DRAWING BUFFER a canvas box asks for, and WHERE THE PAGE IS VISIBLE.
//
// A WebGL canvas has two sizes that are only related because something keeps
// them related: the CSS box the browser lays out, and the pixel buffer the
// GPU draws into. The browser stretches the second onto the first, so a
// disagreement between them is never a missing row of pixels — it is the
// whole picture pulled along one axis, which is what a phone turned on its
// side looks like when nothing has re-measured it.
//
// A PAGE has two sizes for the same reason: the layout viewport it is laid
// out in, and the visible window the browser is currently showing of it. A
// disagreement between THOSE is a shell that is mostly off the screen with
// the app's background colour where the game should be.
//
// The arithmetic of keeping both pairs agreed lives here rather than in the
// renderer or in the page so it can be exercised with nothing standing up
// but Node: what a box measured between layouts turns into, what the pixel
// ratio is capped at, where the visible window sits, and which measurements
// are worth acting on. `visible-viewport.ts` is the half that listens.

 * of `Infinity` or `NaN`, which reaches the projection matrix and draws
 * nothing at all until the app is restarted.
 *
 * `scale` is the RESOLUTION row's share (`settings-video.ts`), applied AFTER
 * the cap rather than before it: the cap is the page's own policy about a
 * dense screen and the row is the rider's about their machine, so a rider who
 * asks for half gets half of what the page was going to draw anyway, on every

/**
 * The visible window inside a layout viewport `layoutHeight` CSS px tall.
 *
 * The two viewports are normally the same box and this returns the whole
 * thing. They come apart when the browser shows only part of the page while
 * leaving the page laid out at full height — a software keyboard is the one
 * that happens here, and it takes about 245 of an iPhone's 393 landscape px.
 * The page is not re-laid for it: the visible window is made short and slid
 * DOWN the layout viewport so the field being typed into stays in view, and
 * a `position: fixed` shell stays behind with the layout viewport, mostly
 * off the screen. Anything anchored to a viewport edge therefore has to be
 * anchored to THIS box instead, and the caller publishes it as the
 * `--shell-*` custom properties the stylesheet reads.
 *
 * A PINCH-ZOOMED visual viewport is a lens rather than a smaller screen —
 * its height is the layout viewport's divided by the scale — so anything but
 * 1 is no opinion and the whole layout viewport comes back. The page locks
 * zoom out in its viewport meta, so this is the case that should not arise
 * rather than the case that is handled.
 *
 * Everything is rounded to whole px and clamped into the layout viewport:
 * the numbers are read back as lengths on the shell, and a fractional or
 * out-of-range one is a blurred edge or a shell with no height at all.
 *
 * `keyboard` is whether anything is being typed into. A strip of viewport
 * BELOW the visible window is a keyboard's and nothing else's, so with no
 * field focused the window is taken to reach the layout's bottom whatever
 * the reading says. That is not a nicety: an installed iOS app brought back
 * from the background can read its two viewports out of step — the layout
 * still the height it had in the other orientation, or the visual window
 * caught mid-relayout — and once the browser has settled it often sends no
 * notice to measure again. Believed, such a reading is a bottom strip as
 * tall as the screen, the shell squeezed to a sliver along the top, and the
 * app's background colour everywhere else until it is restarted. The top
 * offset is still reported with nothing focused, because a window left slid
 * down by a keyboard that has gone is real, and the caller scrolls it back.
