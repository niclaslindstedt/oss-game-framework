// THE UPDATE WATCH: registers a build's service worker (`sw.js` under the
// app's base), and says when a newer build is sitting in the wings.
//
// A worker's lifecycle is per-page, not per-component, so the state lives at
// MODULE scope and whatever the UI reads it through is only a window onto it:
// registration happens once however many components ask, and a remount never
// re-registers or loses the fact that an update is already waiting.
//
// UI-FRAMEWORK-FREE. What this hands out is an external store — `subscribe`
// and `getSnapshot` — which is exactly the pair `useSyncExternalStore` takes
// in React and in `preact/compat`, so a game's hook is one line:
//
//   const watch = pwaUpdateWatch({ base, cacheId });
//   const state = useSyncExternalStore(watch.subscribe, watch.getSnapshot);
//
// It reports only what the app draws — whether a build is waiting and which
// one. Install progress is deliberately not tracked: nothing renders a fill,
// and the only honest way to measure one is to poll the Cache API against
// `precache-manifest.json` several times a second for the whole download.
