 * A touch control that trusts only its own pointerup is a control that
 * eventually STICKS: the finger is gone, the axis it wrote is not, and — the
 * zone still believing it is owned — no later touch can take it back. A
 * throttle lever is the worst case of it: a lever left open by a lost
 * pointerup is a vehicle that drives itself into the scenery.
 *
 * So the release is armed five ways: the zone's own pointerup/cancel (in the
 * HUD), the same events anywhere in the window — once capture is gone the
 * finger lifts over whatever element it is over — the app losing focus or
 * visibility, the watchdog above, and the zone unmounting. `letGo` is the
 * zone's own reset and must be safe to run when nothing is held: it is what
 * dispose leaves behind, so that a HUD which is not on screen is a HUD
 * holding no control down.
