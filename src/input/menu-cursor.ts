 * shared line first is what makes right mean the button next to this one,
 * and the second tier is what still gets a cursor out of a grid's last
 * column.
 *
 * With nothing ahead the cursor WRAPS to the far end — a list that stops
 * dead at the bottom makes a player walk all the way back up to reach the
 * button under their thumb.
