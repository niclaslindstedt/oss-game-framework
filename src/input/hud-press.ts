// HOW A HUD BUTTON IS PRESSED WHILE A THUMB IS ALREADY DOWN.
//
// `click` is not an event the browser owes every touch. It is an ACTIVATION
// event, synthesised from the PRIMARY pointer alone — the first finger on the
// glass — and a phone playing a racing game always has that finger spoken
// for: it is on the steering zone or on the throttle. Every other finger is non-primary, so
// a tap on CAMERA, RESET or PAUSE while the vehicle is being driven raises
// `pointerdown` and `pointerup` on the button and NO CLICK AT ALL. Nothing is
// covering the button and nothing swallows the touch; the button simply never
// hears the one event it was listening for.
//
// Measured, both ways, in Chromium at 390x844 with touch on:
//
//   button alone   pointerdown(primary=true)  pointerup  click
//   zone held      pointerdown(primary=false) pointerup  -
//
// So an in-run press is driven from the POINTER events, which every finger
// gets, and the click that may or may not follow is swallowed rather than
// allowed to fire the action a second time.
//
// DOM-free, like `thumb-guard.ts` beside it and for the same reason: the
// events are typed structurally so a test can ride the whole state machine
// on plain Node. The glue that measures the button and
// reads the clock is `pressHandlers`, at the foot of the file.

 * mouse presses through `click` exactly as it always did, and touch and pen
 * press through the pointer events because for them `click` is not on offer.
