// the HUD's own layer as a document. The canvas work that acts on all of it
// is the game's capture and `shot-hud.ts`.
//
// DOM-FREE, deliberately and load-bearingly. These are the parts of taking
// a picture that are arithmetic rather than graphics, and keeping them out
// of reach of a canvas is what lets the test suite hold them to a promise —
// a stamp is drawn into the corner of a picture that leaves the game, and
// nobody ever sees it before it does.
//
// THE MARK GOES BOTTOM RIGHT, and not by coin toss. A chase camera puts the
// vehicle middle-bottom of the frame, the sky and the race clock own the
// top, and the bottom-left is where a racing HUD stands its speed — the
// instrument a rider reads most. What the bottom-right corner has instead is
// usually a news column, which comes and goes: `stampLift` below is what
// walks the badge up past whatever HUD is there.
