// THE FILMSTRIP'S THUMBNAILS — one small picture per shot, made once and
// kept for as long as the shot is on the roll, so that showing the whole
// roll costs what a strip of eighty-pixel tiles should cost.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. A screenshot is the window it was taken through,
// which is to say around two million pixels; the strip draws it at about
// seven thousand. Handing the original straight to an `<img>` makes the
// browser decode all two million anyway and hold the bitmap — eight
// megabytes a tile, forty tiles on a full roll — and it does the decoding
// on the main thread, which on this card is also the thread stepping the
// game behind the menu. That is a stall you can feel from the press.
//
// So the picture is shrunk before it is ever shown. `createImageBitmap`
// does the decode AND the resize off the main thread, which is the whole
// point of using it rather than an `<img>` and a canvas; what comes back is
// re-encoded small and handed out as an object URL, so the markup stays an
// ordinary `<img>` and the CSS stays the CSS.
//
// ONE AT A TIME. Forty shrinks started together are forty decodes in
// flight, and a browser that obliges is a browser with no memory left for
// the frame. The queue below is the throttle; the gallery's own viewport
// gating is what decides which tiles ever ask.
//
// NOTHING HERE MAY THROW. A browser without `createImageBitmap`, a canvas
// that would not give up a context, a blob that will not decode: each one
// falls back to the full picture, which is exactly what the strip showed
// before this module existed — slower, and still a gallery.
