// THE HUD, ON ITS WAY INTO A PICTURE. The instruments are DOM over the
// canvas, so none of them are in the drawing buffer a screenshot is lifted
// from — this is the half that puts them there.
//
// Two steps, and the split is timing rather than tidiness:
//
//   `readHudLayer` is SYNCHRONOUS and is called at the SHUTTER:
//   the picture has to carry the clock, the lap and the place that
//   were on screen when the button went down, and the frame that serves the
//   request is one or three later. It serializes and nothing more — no
//   decode, no canvas — so a press never costs a frame.
//
//   `drawHudLayer` is ASYNCHRONOUS and runs with the stamp and the encode,
//   long after the drawing buffer has been read.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS LOAD-BEARING. Every failure — a browser that will not
// paint a `<foreignObject>`, a stylesheet it will not read back, a decode
// that never resolves — leaves the picture exactly as it was before the HUD
// was asked for: the frame on its own. A screenshot is never lost over its
// instruments.
//
// TWO THINGS A LAYER CANNOT REPRODUCE, neither worth the machinery it would
// take to: `backdrop-filter` has nothing behind it inside an image, so a
// card over the run comes out translucent rather than frosted; and the
// safe-area insets are zero in there, so a notched phone puts its
// instruments a few pixels off where the screen had them. Both are
// fractions of a HUD that is otherwise the browser's own layout of the
// game's own stylesheet.
//
// WHAT THE LAYER CARRIES is the HUD and the finish plate — the chrome that
// belongs to the RACE. A card over it does not come along, nor does a
// replay's transport bar: the pause card's
// PICTURE row is pressed with the card up, and the picture it asked for is
// the frozen race under the card, never a photograph of the button that
// took it. The CANVAS is left out too, because it IS the picture.
