// THE SCREENSHOT ROLL, kept: an IndexedDB store around the policy in
// shot-roll.ts, plus the subscription the gallery watches it through.
//
// INDEXEDDB RATHER THAN localStorage, which is where every other persisted
// thing in a game lives (the settings, the records, the ghosts). Those are
// kilobytes of JSON; a single 1920-wide PNG of a 3D world is hundreds of
// kilobytes, and localStorage's whole budget
// is 5 MB of UTF-16 that base64 would inflate by a third before the first
// picture was even stored. IndexedDB is the one API in the browser that
// takes a Blob as a Blob.
//
// IT MUST NEVER BE LOAD-BEARING. A private-mode tab, a browser with storage
// switched off, a quota that filled up mid-write: all ordinary, and none of
// them may stop a picture being taken. Every entry point here resolves
// rather than rejects, and a database that would not open leaves the roll
// living in memory for as long as the tab does — the player still gets the
// receipt, the gallery and the share sheet, and only loses the pictures
// when they close the game.
