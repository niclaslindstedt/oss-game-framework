 * to make it unavailable. Nothing reads the store until the gallery is opened
 * (`loadShots` has one caller), so on a visit where nobody opened it the roll
 * in hand is exactly what THIS visit has taken; a prune against that set
 * deletes every picture the player has ever taken, one frame after the first
 * press of the session.
 *
 * Keys are enough because `shotId` is built to make them enough: the capture
 * time leads, so a plain string sort is a sort by age. Which also means the
 * prune never has to read a single PNG back off disk to know what to keep —
 * a `getAll` on a full roll is some thirty megabytes pulled into memory in
 * the middle of a run, to answer a question about order.
