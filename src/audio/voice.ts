// WHAT A VOICE IS — the parameter shapes every sound in the game is written
// in, and the interface the instrument that plays them presents.
//
// Split from the instrument itself (`synth.ts`) because these types are read
// by code that must stay DOM-FREE: the sound bank, the event router, the beds
// and the tests over all of them describe sounds without ever making one, and
// the moment any of them reaches for `synth.ts` it drags `AudioContext` into
// a build that has no browser in it.
//
// So: this file is the vocabulary, `synth.ts` is the only thing that can
// pronounce it.
//
// TWO KINDS OF VOICE, and the split is the whole design of the audio:
//
//   * A ONE-SHOT (`tone`, `noise`) starts, does its envelope and stops. A
//     thump, a crack, a chime. Everything in the bank.
//   * A LAYER (`layer`) never stops. It is a node graph that stays built for
//     the whole run and is STEERED — its pitch, its level, its cutoff are
//     moved on the audio thread with smoothed parameter automation. The
//     engine, the drive, the surface and the wind are all layers.
//     Nothing about a layer depends on the frame rate: a stalled main thread
//     leaves it holding its last value, never with a hole in it.

 * bubble (a few milliseconds of sine through a bandpass, several a second
 * after a landing) the ring IS the sound the player hears, and it reads as a
 * broken speaker rather than as anything at all.
 *
 * A millisecond and a half of ramp is far below the ~10 ms the ear resolves as
 * an attack, so nothing is softened and every percussive voice keeps its snap;
 * it is purely the discontinuity that goes. It is only ever a FLOOR — a voice
