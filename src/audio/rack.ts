// A RACK OF LAYERS — the one piece of plumbing every bed shares.
//
// A bed is a table of layer specs, a table of glides, and a function from
// the state to a table of targets. This is what stands between that function
// and the synth: it builds each layer the first time it is asked for,
// rebuilds one whose context has gone away under it (the iOS zombie
// replacement), and steers every one toward its target on its own glide.
// It never throws and never blocks: a layer the synth cannot build yet — the
// context is still locked — is simply tried again next frame.
