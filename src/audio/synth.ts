// The instrument every sound in a game is played on: a small WebAudio
// synthesizer. Nothing ships as an audio file — a sound is a list of
// parameters, which keeps the app tiny, keeps it offline, and makes the
// sound design as diffable as a vehicle's own spec.
//
// THE REGISTER IS A MODERN ARCADE RACER, NOT A CHIP. A chip voice is an
// oscillator with an envelope: bright, thin, unmistakably synthetic. What a
// racing machine sounds like is a small engine with grit in it, a drive that
// whines, a surface that hisses under it, and the wind. Four things in this
// synth exist to reach that and none of them are chip:
//
//   * NOISE HAS A COLOUR. White noise is a hiss; brown noise is a rumble, and
//     a rumble is what a hull, a tyre on gravel and a landing are made of.
//     Pink sits between them and is the spray, snow and wind band.
//   * NOISE HAS AN ENVELOPE. A chip's noise burst is a flat block that stops.
//     A real texture swells, holds and thins out.
//   * FILTERS SWEEP. A static cutoff is a tone colour; a moving one is a
//     GESTURE — a plume off the drive, a nose burying and coming back up, the
//     whoosh past an obstacle.
//   * OSCILLATORS SATURATE. `drive` folds a waveform through a soft curve,
//     which is how a triangle becomes an engine instead of a flute.
//
// AND THE BEDS ARE NOT ONE-SHOTS. The engine, the drive, the surface and the
// wind are LAYERS: node graphs built once and steered with smoothed
// parameter automation on the audio thread (`layer()`). That is the whole
// difference between this instrument and a sampler being asked to fake a
// continuous sound out of overlapping grains — a layer has no cadence to
// tile, no phase to align, no backlog to fire when the main thread stalls,
// and it costs the audio thread a fixed handful of nodes instead of a
// hundred and fifty fresh ones a second. A stalled frame leaves it holding
// its last value; it never leaves a hole.
//
// Everything else is the classic arrangement: an attack/hold/decay envelope,
// a detuned second oscillator for width, delayed vibrato, stereo pan, and one
// shared feedback-delay bus every voice can send into so overlapping sounds
// sit in the same place.

// The types are NOT re-exported from here on purpose: a module that wanted
// only `ToneOptions` would pull this whole file — and `AudioContext` with it —
// into builds that have no browser. Everything that merely DESCRIBES a sound
// imports from `voice.ts`; this file is for making one.
