## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately — **do not open a public issue**.

- Preferred: open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/oss-game-framework/security/advisories/new).
- Alternatively, email **niclas@agilator.se** with details and reproduction steps.

## Response expectations

- Acknowledgment within **5 business days**.
- An initial assessment and triage within **10 business days**.

## Disclosure policy

We follow coordinated disclosure: we will agree on a disclosure window with the
reporter and credit them unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

In scope: the published package code under `src/`, `tooling/` and `bin/`, and the committed `dist/`.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in the consuming application, in transitive
dependencies (report those upstream), or in the sibling games cloned only for local analysis.
