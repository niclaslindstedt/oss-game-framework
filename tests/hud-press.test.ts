// THE IN-RUN PRESS. `click` is synthesised from the PRIMARY pointer only, and
// a phone playing a racing game has that pointer spoken for — it is the
// thumb on the steering zone or on the throttle. So every button drawn over a run is pressed
// from the pointer events instead, and the click that may or may not follow
// is swallowed rather than allowed to fire the action twice.
//
// Measured in Chromium at 390x844 with touch on: a button tapped alone gets
// pointerdown(primary=true), pointerup and click; the same button tapped with
// a finger held in a thumb zone gets pointerdown(primary=false) and pointerup
// and NO CLICK. That is the bug this module exists for, and these are its
// claims.
