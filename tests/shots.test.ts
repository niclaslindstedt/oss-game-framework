// SCREENSHOTS — the parts of taking a picture that are arithmetic rather
// than graphics, and can therefore be held to a promise with no canvas
// anywhere near them. Both modules under test are DOM-free on purpose, and
// this file is what that buys.
//
// Three things are load-bearing. The ROLL must stay capped and newest
// first, because a roll that quietly stopped capping is an unbounded pile
// of megabytes in somebody's browser profile, and nothing in a game ever
// prompts a player to prune one. The STAMP must stay a signature at every
// size a window can be, because it is drawn into the corner of a picture
// that leaves the game and nobody sees it before it does. And the PICTURE
// must never be blown UP: a screenshot is worth exactly what the renderer
// drew, and not one interpolated pixel more.
//
// What is NOT here is everything that needs a canvas or a document — the
// grab off the drawing buffer, the HUD rasterized into the frame, the PNG
// encode, the IndexedDB roll behind it. Those are judged by LOOKING, in the
// games' own screenshot labs; these are judged by arithmetic.
