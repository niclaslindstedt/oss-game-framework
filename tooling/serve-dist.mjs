// SERVING THE BUILT SITE to a headless browser. Every browser-driven tool in
// a game's `scripts/` needs the same thing — the built site on a real origin, on a port
// nobody has to pick — and the reason it is an HTTP server rather than a
// `file://` URL is not tidiness: the service worker, the manifest and
// `localStorage` all behave differently, or not at all, off an opaque origin.
//
// It serves the built site AS DEPLOYED: a directory request falls back to that
// directory's `index.html`, which is how static pages (`/privacy/`,
// `/support/`) are reached, and an unknown path 404s rather than
// being rewritten to the app — a tool asking for a file that is not in the
// build should hear so, not get the game back with a 200.
