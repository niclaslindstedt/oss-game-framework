// A HEADLESS CHROMIUM for the browser-driven labs, found the same way by all
// of them. The driver is DELIBERATELY not a dependency of this repository —
// a browser driver is a hundred megabytes nobody needs to build or test a
// game — so it is looked for in two places: `playwright-core` installed
// beside the tree (`npm install --no-save playwright-core@1`), and a
// `playwright` installed globally next to the running Node, which is what a
// Claude web session ships with. The browser itself is CHROMIUM_PATH, or
// /opt/pw-browsers/chromium.
//
// Returns null — never throws — when either half is missing, so a lab can
// say what it needs and exit cleanly rather than stack-trace.
